# Cove Project Quality

Use this workflow for any non-trivial change. Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the closest scoped instructions before editing.

## Execute

1. Inspect `git status -sb` and preserve unrelated work.
2. State assumptions, scope, and measurable success criteria.
3. Search SwiftUI views, view models, services, SwiftData models, shared design tokens, Keychain helpers, and existing XCTest or UI-test targets before creating a new concern home.
4. Reproduce bugs or contract gaps with the narrowest useful test.
5. Implement the smallest complete fix and update every touched caller, export, registry, migration, and contract.

## Verify

Run the narrowest XCTest target first, then an `xcodebuild` build and relevant tests against an installed simulator; exercise the changed flow in Simulator when UI, persistence, permissions, or accessibility changed.

Do not infer success from a status flag, HTTP 200, mock, or healthy container alone. Inspect the real Capture to Classify to Confirm to Complete flow, persisted SwiftData state, visible error or recovery state, and accessible VoiceOver and keyboard behavior where applicable. Exercise negative authorization and failure or recovery cases whenever those boundaries changed.

## Review and handoff

Material production, security, isolation, autonomous-mutation, persistence, provider-routing, or public-UI changes require the independent exact-commit review in `.github/ai-review/senior-review.md`. HIGH or MEDIUM findings block merge or deployment.

Report exact branch and head, tests and probes run, runtime or public evidence, review status, rollback and cleanup state, and anything still unverified. Never fabricate evidence.
