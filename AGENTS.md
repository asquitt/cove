# Cove Agent Guidelines

## Autonomous Delivery Standard

These rules govern implementation, diagnosis, review, release, and handoff. More specific project invariants below remain binding.

### Scope and planning

- State assumptions, scope, and measurable success criteria before multi-step work.
- Turn the plan into `step -> verification` pairs and keep it current.
- Proceed autonomously with routine, reversible work inside the requested scope.
- Stop for missing credentials, destructive or production-wide actions, ownership conflicts, or choices that materially change the product.
- A request to diagnose, review, or report is read-only unless the user also authorizes changes.
- Inspect `git status -sb` first. Preserve unrelated tracked, untracked, staged, and generated work.

### Simplicity and adoption

- Write the minimum code that completely solves the requested problem.
- Search callers, registries, shared services, adapters, hooks, and existing implementations before adding a new abstraction or concern home.
- Extend the canonical layer when responsibility is the same. If a shared layer changes, migrate the touched callers rather than creating a sibling implementation.
- Do not add speculative configuration, redundant fallback paths, or infrastructure for remote hypotheticals.
- Update affected imports, exports, routers, task maps, migrations, schemas, clients, and documentation.
- Remove only dead code made obsolete by the current change. Do not clean unrelated debt.

### Outcome truth and no false greens

- A passing test, HTTP 200, status flag, database row, mock, screenshot, or healthy container is evidence, not proof of the claimed outcome.
- Verify the real producer, persistence, ownership boundary, consumer, and user or operator-visible result.
- For Cove, the Capture to Classify to Confirm to Complete flow must render in Simulator, persist correct SwiftData state, preserve Daily Contract limits, expose recoverable errors, and remain accessible without leaking the user's API key.
- Mocks and deterministic fixtures are acceptable development evidence only. Label them clearly and do not use them to support live-provider or production claims.
- Deployment proof requires exact repository, revision, artifact or image, configuration contract, health behavior, and rendered application identity.
- Never weaken a customer-facing claim to make QA pass. Fix the behavior or request an explicit positioning decision.

### Verification

- Bug fix: reproduce with a focused regression, implement the smallest fix, and prove the regression now passes.
- Start with the narrowest relevant checks, then run changed-file gates and broader build, integration, E2E, security, or release gates in proportion to risk.
- The normal Cove path is the narrowest XCTest target, an `xcodebuild` build and relevant test target against an installed simulator, plus direct Simulator interaction for UI, persistence, permissions, or accessibility changes.
- Test negative and adversarial cases for auth, isolation, validation, retries, partial failure, rollback, and cleanup when those boundaries change.
- Verify APIs with actual requests and response bodies, UI with a real render and interaction, persistence with stored and reloaded state, and background work with produced results and logs.
- If a required gate cannot run, report exactly what passed, what failed, and what remains unverified.

### Independent senior review

- Material production behavior, security boundaries, autonomous mutations, persistence, provider routing, migrations, deployment controls, and public UI changes require one separate independent xhigh review of an immutable base-to-head commit.
- Give the reviewer the full base and head SHAs, user requirements, affected architecture, tests, and runtime context. The reviewer is read-only and follows `.github/ai-review/senior-review.md`.
- HIGH or MEDIUM findings require a plausible current trigger, concrete impact, reproducible evidence, an affected file and line, and the smallest sufficient fix.
- Freeze the candidate on any admitted blocker. Fix narrowly, rerun relevant gates, commit a new head, and request one bounded re-review from the same reviewer.
- LOW, speculative, unrelated, stylistic, and non-reproducible observations do not extend the cycle.
- CI, previews, and deployment checks are separate evidence and do not replace independent review.

### Git, secrets, and production safety

- Stage and commit only files belonging to the current task. Use conventional, coherent commits without AI co-author trailers.
- Push once at the requested or final handoff boundary. Never force-push, rewrite history, or change remotes unless explicitly requested.
- Never print, log, screenshot, commit, or place secrets in command arguments. Source only required variables from an approved local or external secret store.
- Production starts read-only: verify target, identity, health, logs, rollback, and cleanup path before mutation.
- Never run destructive database, provider, deployment, or filesystem operations against an unresolved or broad target.
- Do not claim deployment, rollback, cleanup, or public verification that was not directly observed.

### Handoff

Report the exact branch and head, files changed, tests and probes run, runtime or public evidence, independent-review result, rollback and cleanup state, and remaining risks. Distinguish complete, partial, blocked, and unverified work explicitly.

### Cove risk focus

Prioritize SwiftData migration and persistence, MainActor and cancellation behavior, Keychain secrets, Speech and EventKit permissions, duplicate AI requests, offline recovery, VoiceOver, and Meltdown accessibility.

## Repository map

`Cove/Cove/` contains the SwiftUI app, models, views, view models, services, and utilities; `Cove/Cove.xcodeproj` is the Xcode project; app and UI tests live beside the project targets.

## Essential commands

```bash
xcodebuild -project Cove/Cove.xcodeproj -scheme Cove -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<installed-device>' build
xcodebuild -project Cove/Cove.xcodeproj -scheme Cove -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<installed-device>' test
```

## Codex-specific guidance

- Follow the closest `AGENTS.md` in the directory hierarchy and use project-local skills under `.agents/skills/`.
- Use `rg` or `rg --files` for search.
- Use subagents only for independent work or when the user or instructions request parallelism.
- Prefer purpose-built tools over UI control and keep progress updates concise.
